                The World Bank is an international financial institution that provides loans and grants to the
                governments of low- and middle-income countries for the purpose of pursuing capital projects.[5] The
                World Bank is the collective name for the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)
                and International Development Association (IDA), two of five international organizations owned by the
                World Bank Group. It was established along with the International Monetary Fund at the 1944 Bretton
                Woods Conference. After a slow start, its first loan was to France in 1947. In the 1970s, it focused on
                loans to developing world countries, shifting away from that mission in the 1980s. For the last 30
                years, it has included NGOs and environmental groups in its loan portfolio. Its loan strategy is
                influenced by the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals, as well as environmental and social
                safeguards.
