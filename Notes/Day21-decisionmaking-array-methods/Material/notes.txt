Decision making we have two things:
1.ifelse 
2.switch statement
//you use number,string to check multiple scenario 
//break keyword is mandatory to be used after every case.
//default is optional if you need to show not matching condition you can use it.
===================================
//If you have single statement go with ternary operator.
//if you have multiple statement to be written with two condtions yes or not you can use if else statement.
